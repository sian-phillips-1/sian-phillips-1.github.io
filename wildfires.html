  <h1>Australian Wildfires</h1>
  <p><b>The aim:</b> To visualise data on the Australian wildfires and incorporate
    it with national park spatial data to highlight the desructive nature 
    of the fires.

<h2> The Process </h2>
<p>The wildfires of the
    2019-2020
    bush fire season in Australia
    were
    some of the
    worst
    on
    record,
    impacting 19 million
    hectares of land
    and
    destroy
    ing
    the
    habitats
    of
    over 3 billion
    native
    animals.
    This damage occurred in many of Australiaâ€™s
    Protected areas,
    which cover over 22.1% of the country
    and contain significant ecological
    landscapes.
The visualisation
    examines
    the
    relationship between wildfires and protected
    areas during this time</p>
<p>My interest was drawn to the landscape affected by the 
    wildfires and I wanted to understand what type of land was being burned. 
    The data on protected areas gave me this information as it provided 
    insight into the significant environmental regions across Australia. 
    These regions are often protected for important reasons, as they can 
    contain valuable ecosystems and habitats of endangered species. </p>
<p>The intention of the visualisation was to communicate the reality of 
    the effect of wildfires on the natural environment. I wanted to add 
    context to the devastating impact that the wildfires had and continue 
    to have in Australia. Most people have an understanding of what a 
    protected area is, they associate it with beautiful landscapes or 
    endangered species. I wanted to use this pre-existing association 
    to create an emotional response and connection to the data. To 
    achieve this fully, I intended to highlight specific areas that were 
    affected and display the number of wildfires occurred over the 
    one-month time-period. This would place the large numbers in context 
    and on a smaller scale, making the reality easier to grasp. 
    The intention was to not be overly aggressive with the message but 
    use the visualisation to guide readers to reach their own conclusion. 
    Most importantly, I wanted to tell a story about the real 
    environmental impact, not just an aesthetically pleasing representation 
    of wildfire coordinates. Therefore, it was key for the design choices 
    not to embellish the information but to try and encode it in an honest 
    and precise manner. </p>
<p> <strong> R </strong> was used for all the plotting. 
    The packages used were:
    <ul>
        <li><code>dplyr</code>: for cleaning the data.</li>
        <li><code>maps</code>: for the geographical map of Australia.</li>
        <li><code>mapdata</code>: for the zoomed in region of Australia. </li>
        <li><code>sf</code>: for encoding spacial vector data of the wildfires and protected land regions.</li>
    </ul>
