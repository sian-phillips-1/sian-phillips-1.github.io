  <h1>Childcare Costs Project </h1>
  <p>This project was made during my master's degree in response to a 
    brief set out by the West Midlands Combined Authority. <b>The aim:</b> 
    to convey was that childcare costs are disproportionately borne by the most deprived households,
    and the infographics and visualisations should make visible the challenges of this.

<p>To execute the aim of the project I wanted to utilise the method of 
    comparison to channel the focus of the audience. The story in the 
    final outcome revolves around two mothers in the West Midlands one 
    living in a deprived area with high childcare costs and one living 
    in an area with low deprivation and low childcare costs. I gave the 
    characters names and pictures to humanise the data points and 
    emphasise the ‘realness’ of the issue. </p>
    <p>The audience for my final visualisation would primarily be the 
        public, but the visual could also be used by organisations that 
        are looking to help parents that are struggling with their 
        childcare costs. </p>
<p> <strong> R </strong> was used for cleaning, analysing and plotting all data. 
    <strong> Canva </strong> was used for the finishing touches. The people illustrations 
    were from the 
    collection available in <strong>Canva</strong>.
</p>

<p>  The basic charts, that were produced in R, can be seen on the right. 
    The colour scheme and fonts used were
    replicated from the offical West Midlands design template.
