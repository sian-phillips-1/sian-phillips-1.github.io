  <h1>Childcare Costs Project </h1>
  <p class="narrow">This infographic was made to convey the 
    challenges of childcare costs being
    disproportionately borne by the most deprived households.
    The brief was set out by the <a href = "https://www.wmca.org.uk/">
      West Midlands Combined Authority</a>.

<p>To execute the aim of the project I wanted to utilise the method of 
    comparison to channel the focus of the audience. The story in the 
    final outcome revolves around two mothers in the West Midlands, one 
    living in a deprived area with high childcare costs and one living 
    in an area with low deprivation and low childcare costs. I gave the 
    characters names and pictures to humanise the data points and 
    emphasise the ‘realness’ of the issue. </p>

<p> <strong> R </strong> was used for cleaning, analysing and plotting all data. 
    <strong> Canva </strong> was used for the finishing touches. The illustrations 
    of the mothers were from the 
    collection of icons available in <strong>Canva</strong>.
</p>

<p>  The basic charts, that were produced in <strong>R</strong>, can be seen on the right. 
    The packages used included:
    <ul>
        <li><code>dplyr</code>: for cleaning the data.</li>
        <li><code>ggplot</code>: for plotting the donut chart, the line chart and the scatter plot.</li>
        <li><code>RcolorBrewer</code>: for creating a unique colour palatte to use in the plots. </li>
        <li><code>sf</code>: for encoding spacial vector data of the IMD scores and childcare costs for each area in the West Midlands.</li>
    </ul>
    The colour scheme and fonts used were
    replicated from the offical West Midlands design template.
