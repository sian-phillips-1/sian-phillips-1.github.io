  <h1>Trans Panic </h1>
  <p><b> The aim:</b> to use data visualisations to explain the key 
    components of transgender moral panic in the UK. The project 
    looks to provide a rational and evidence-based approach to a complex 
    societal issue. The data visualisations are designed to enhance 
    engagement and understanding of trans panic. By challenging 
    attitudes and practices that continue to drive the panic it is the 
    hope that society can move towards a more equitable and 
    compassionate approach to gender identity and expression.

<h2> The Process </h2>
<div class="container2">
<p>Transgender issues have become increasingly prevalent in, the news 
    media, political debates and public discussion. This heightened 
    coverage and attention has framed transgender people as a threat to 
    moral norms and has induced a sense of panic surrounding related
     gender issues. This study uses data visualisation along with Stanley 
     Cohen’s framework of ‘moral panic’ to investigate and explain trans 
     panic in the UK. Through the investigation it was observed that 
     trends in the news media, public opinion, policy, and transgender 
     people’s experiences, align with those typical of a moral panic. In 
     relation to transgender issues; media coverage has been increasing, 
     the public have become less accepting, policies designed to support 
     legal gender recognition have been blocked and transgender people are 
     facing rising levels of harassment, along with other negative side
      effects. By utilising the method of data visualisation, this project 
      aims to speak to a broad audience, promoting better understanding of 
      a highly relevant social issue in a clear and concise manner.</p>

    <p> All the graphs were created in <strong> R </strong> using a combination 
        of <code>Base-R</code> and <code>ggplot2</code>.
        The <code>BeautifulSoup</code> package in <strong>Python</strong> was 
        used to scrape online articles. To analyse the language used in news article 
        headlines and extract the most common words, the package 
        <code>collections</code> was used. Some of the basic charts can be seen 
        in the image above. These were exported from <strong>R</strong> into 
        <strong>Figma</strong> where the colours, fonts and designs were tweaked
        to fit with the style of the final visualisation piece. 
    </p>
    <p> The pages on the left, used in the final design, were made 
        during a workshop at the very start of the project when brainstorming
        for ideas. The strong colours of the red, black and orange created 
        a boldness that I wanted to carry over into my final project. I was also 
        drawn to the idea of making imprints with leaves, symbolising a sense of lasting-impact and permanence. 
        In these leaves, and throughout nature are 
    repeating patterns, often made sense of by the Fibonacci Sequence and the Golden Ratio. 
    This inspired me to connect the patterns of nature with my visualisation about 
    patterns in society.
