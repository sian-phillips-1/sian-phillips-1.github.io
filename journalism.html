  <h2>Health issues among working-age population raise concerns for economic productivity </h2>
<p>A recent analysis of workplace sickness in the UK has revealed 
    that low productivity is costing businesses an additional Â£25 
    billion. The Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) who 
    published the report, attributes these hidden costs to employees 
    working through poor health, rather than taking time off.</p>
<p>Since 2016, there has been a noticeable increase in reported health 
    concerns among the working-age population. The proportion of adults 
    experiencing either one or two health conditions has risen from 21% 
    in 2016 to 25% in 2023.</p>

<p>
The implication of poor health can have even further negative effects 
on ecocomic productivity if individuals become unable to work due to 
long-term sickness. In response to public concern, the IPPR have 
proposed a plan to encourage a more harmonious relationship between 
well-being and work. The strategy to improve employee health involves 
tax incentives, regulations for employers, and compulsory reporting on 
worker health.</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">The basic charts were produced in <strong>R</strong> and can be seen on the left.
    The font and colour palette gave direction to the design style of 
    the visuals. The fine-tuning was done in <strong>Figma</strong>.
<p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">
    Two alternative visualisations can be seen on the right. These have
    more colour and elements however, for a news article I felt it would 
    be more appropriate to have a simple design to not distract from the 
    key message.
