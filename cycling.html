  <p><b>The aim:</b> To pick a theme/issue and explore it through both the data 
    I collected
    in my personal data journal and a dataset from an external source.

<p>I chose to explore the theme of cycling, specifically the attitudes 
    towards it, gathering data from my own personal experience and 
    comparing to wider society. I wanted to investigate the reasons why
     people decide not to cycle and what may encourage more people to do 
     so. This is an issue I feel is both important to me personally as 
     it is something I enjoy but also important to society and the 
     environment, as cycling is a way to reduce carbon emissions and 
     live a healthier life. Through my experiences I could compare 
     factors important to me in my trips with other people. The 
     visualisation aims to give insight to inspire change. </p>
     <p>To collect my personal data, I used photographs to keep track of 
        my cycle trips, taking a photo of where I parked my bike and a 
        photo when I reached my destination. On my phone I edited the 
        photograph and added my data as text. This gave me options when 
        it came to visualising the data, as I had access to the GPS 
        locations, time stamps, and visual depictions to work with.</p>  
        <p>The final layout of the visualisation consists of four 
            circular diagrams that resemble wheels of a bike, with data 
            encoded through lines symbolising spokes. This design choice 
            was inspired by Federica Frangapane’s work, which employs 
            shape and colour to present data in intricate patterns. 
            Figure 7 shows one of her visualisations which I used to 
            help guide me, as it has characteristics of a bike wheel. 
        </p>
        <p>To further continue the theme of cycling and transport I used 
            a line symbolic of a road to split the page between the 
            personal and external data. Overall, the visualisations 
            involve a level of complexity that might take time to 
            understand the different components. This was the intention, 
            drawing from Giorgia Lupi’s standpoint of embracing complexity, 
            taken from her Data Humanism Manifesto (PrintMag, 2017). 
            Following this suggestion, I worked against the idea that the 
            visualisation should be understood at a glance, and aimed my 
            piece at an audience that would be open to spending longer with 
            the information.  </p>
<p> <strong> R </strong> was used for cleaning, analysing and plotting all data. 
    <strong> Canva </strong> for the finishing touches. The people icons were from the 
    Canva collection.
