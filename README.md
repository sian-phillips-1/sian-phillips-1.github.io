#### Health Issues Among Working-Age Population Raise Concerns for Economic Productivity
A recent analysis of workplace sickness in the UK has revealed that low productivity is costing businesses an additional Â£25 billion. The Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) who published the report, attributes these hidden costs to employees working through poor health, rather than taking time off.<br>
<br>
Since 2016, there has been a noticeable increase in reported health concerns among the working-age population. The proportion of adults experiencing either one or two health conditions has risen from 21% in 2016 to 25% in 2023.<br>
<br>
The implication of poor health can have even further negative effects on ecocomic productivity if individuals become unable to work due to long-term sickness. 
In response to public concern, the IPPR have proposed a plan to encourage a more harmonious relationship between well-being and work. The strategy to improve employee health involves tax incentives, regulations for employers, and compulsory reporting on worker health.<br>
